What is CLOSURE
Closures are functions that refer to independent variables .independent variables are those that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope. 
In other words, these functions remember the environment in which they were created.we can say,A function that referenced by some local variables is called a closure. 
This behavior not only frees you from having to worry about lifetimes of variables but also allows for some creative use of function values.
for example

function f1() {
var name="sandeep"
  function displayName() {
    return name;
    }
    return displayName;
  
  }
  


var myFunc = f1();
myFunc();


closure rules
Closures have access to the outer function’s variable even after the outer function returns:
One of the most important and features with closures is that the inner function still has access to the outer function’s variables even after the outer function has returned.
This means that even after the outer function has returned, the inner function still has access to the outer function’s variables.
Therefore, you can call the inner function later in the program.
